- more generalised interface to TWI/I2C... reading different addresses, different setups...

- could have multiple ping pins, if more ultrasound sensors
- use an interrupt and timer to measure ping time, instead of waiting.

-- waitForConfig not yet clean.... maybe just leave out... since it's waiting in the loop for serial data anyway...
