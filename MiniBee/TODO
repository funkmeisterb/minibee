-- baudrates
  - test maybe up to 57600...

-- PING
  - could have multiple ping pins, if more ultrasound sensors
  - use an interrupt and timer to measure ping time, instead of waiting.
  
-- maybe integrate
  - CapSense
  - stepper motor
  - LED matrix
  - more generalised interface to TWI/I2C... reading different addresses, different setups...
