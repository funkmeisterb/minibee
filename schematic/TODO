TODO:
shop for different header solutions 
smaller capacitor package
labels (SCL, SDA - A4 A5)
look for a small switch (what they have on the cui32?)
logo
new accel and/or gyro packages
mounting hole(s)

make part for the battery holder (1054KCT) - done but check again when awake
fuses/breakers? (507-1489-1 replaced by 507-1480-1 on the schematic, same thing but diff package) - done

possible headers (17 pins to breakout + 3.3v, gnd x 2 + rx, tx, rst)
90 degrees headers
bad: connectors are far, loss of board space
good: fits under the xbee's front end.
